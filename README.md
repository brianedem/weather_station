This repository contains two firmware deliverables - one for the weather station, another for the receiver. Both rely on a shared library for managing the 915MHz radio.

The weather station code is located in the weather subdirectory, and includes various other files that provide access to the various weather instruments.

The weather receiver code is located in the weather_rx subdirectory.
